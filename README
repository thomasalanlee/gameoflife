--A Naive Scala implementation of 'Conways Game Of Life'

-Things to fix
1) Extract case statement clauses so that they are independently testable
2) Remove nested for loops (surely there is a higher order function I can use)
3) Find nicer way to construct array. Looks to much like mutation at present
